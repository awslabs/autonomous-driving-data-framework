# SageMaker studio Infrastructure

This module contains the resources that are required to deploy the SageMaker Studio infrastructure. It defines the setup for Amazon SageMaker Studio Domain and creates SageMaker Studio User Profiles for Data Scientists and Lead Data Scientists.

**NOTE** To effectively use this repository you would need to have a good understanding around AWS networking services, AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK.

### SageMaker Studio Stack

This stack handles the deployment of the following resources:

1. SageMaker Studio Domain requires, along with
2. IAM roles which would be linked to SM Studio user profiles. User Profile creating process is managed by manifests files in `manifests/shared-infra/mlops-modules.yaml`. You can simply add new entries in the list to create a new user. The user will be linked to a role depending on which group you add them to (`data_science_users` or `lead_data_science_users`).

```
  - name: data_science_users
    value:
    - data-scientist
  - name: lead_data_science_users
    value:
    - lead-data-scientist
```

3. Default SageMaker Project Templates are also enabled on the account on the targeted region using a custom resource; the custom resource uses a lambda function, `functions/sm_studio/enable_sm_projects`, to make necessary SDK calls to both Amazon Service Catalog and Amazon SageMaker.

## Inputs and outputs:
### Required inputs:
  - `VPC_ID`
  - `subnet_ids`
### Optional Inputs:
  - `studio_domain_name`
  - `studio_bucket_name`
### Outputs (module metadata):
  - `StudioDomainName`
  - `StudioBucketName`
  - `DataScientistRoleArn`
  - `DataScientistRoleSSMName`
  - `LeadDataScientistRoleArn`
  - `LeadDataScientistRoleSSMName`
  - `SageMakerExecutionRoleSSMName`
  - `SageMakerExecutionRoleArn`
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an AWS CDK project written in Python 3.8. Here's what you need to have on your workstation before you can deploy this project. It is preferred to use a linux OS to be able to run all cli commands and avoid path issues.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* [AWS CDK v2](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

## Troubleshooting


* **Resource being used by another resource**

This error is harder to track and would require some effort to trace where is the resource that we want to delete is being used and severe that dependency before running the destroy command again.

**NOTE** You should just really follow CloudFormation error messages and debug from there as they would include details about which resource is causing the error and in some occasion information into what needs to happen in order to resolve it.


* **CDK version X instead of Y**

This error relates to a new update to cdk so run `npm install -g aws-cdk` again to update your cdk to the latest version and then run the deployment step again for each account that your stacks are deployed.

* **`cdk synth`** **not running**

One of the following would solve the problem:

    * Docker is having an issue so restart your docker daemon
    * Refresh your awscli credentials
