# Example DAG Module

## Description

This module demonstrates:

- creating a CDK Stack with Role dedicated to the DAGs
  - within the Stack, grant the MWAA Execution Role permission to assume the created DAG Execution Role
- creating DAGs on a shared MWAA Environment by utilizing Input Parameters
  - within the DAG, demonstrate assuming the DAG Execution Role with service and data permissions specific to the DAG
- exporting Metadata by setting the `SEEDFARMER_MODULE_METADATA` env var on completion
