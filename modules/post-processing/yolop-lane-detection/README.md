# Lane Detection Docker image for ECR 

## Description

This module contains a Docker container for detecting lanes on images using 
YOLOP (https://github.com/hustvl/YOLOP).  It is designed to incorporate the weights, the model code, and the transformation/processing code into one image with the entry point being `tools/detect_lanes.py` when processing. 

NOTE: this image can run on CPU and GPU compute resources

### Full list of parameters for processing code
The `tools/detect_lanes.py` entry point has several parameters that can be overridden.  Please see `tools/detect_lanes.py` for a reference as to the parameters you can override as necessary.  


### Sample Sagemaker Processing Code

A sample piece of code that leverages this image as a Sagemaker Processing job is located at `/src/sample_sm_processor.py`.  The `/src/sample_sm_processor.py` is a working example that does not modify the processing code, only provides references to the images on S3 and where the output should be placed on S3.


    
## Inputs/Outputs

### Input Parameters

#### Required

- `full-access-policy-arn`: Access policy from Datalake Bucket Core Module

#### Optional
- `removal-policy`: Elect to retain ECR repositories when deleting stacks
    
### Sample declaration 

```yaml
name: lane-detection
path: modules/post-processing/yolop-lane-detection/
parameters:
