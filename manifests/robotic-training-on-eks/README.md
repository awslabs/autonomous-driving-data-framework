### Description
This deployment deploys the modules for blog post: How to expansively train Robot Learning on AWS leveraging rewards functions generated by LLM

In summary, it deploys the following components:
- Networking
  - Creates a new VPC and public/private subnets to host EKS cluster and FSx
- Bucket
  - A data bucket used to store input/output
- EKS cluster
  - The core component which is used to schedule and deploy training/simulation workloads
- FSx
  - The external hard drive for training. They will be mounted to training containers. The data will be synced to S3.
- ECR
  - This deployment will deploy two ECRs. One to store robotic training image and one to store DCV (high performance remote desktop streaming tool).
- DCV components
  - This includes building an DCV image and K8S resources which will stream simulation/training applications running in EKS to local dev environment.
- Eureka
  - This is the core component to train robotic simulations, which sets up the correct permission to control job running and talk to LLMs.
